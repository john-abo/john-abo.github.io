                I'm an Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary
                with a passion for creating. I started at the program in 2019, but
                fell in love with programming back in high school. Since then I've
                worked on a few personal projects with my friends, as well as projects
                for the classes I've taken. Although university and my studies have
                taken up much of my time for working on projects, I've always strived
                to create something that at least relates to something I've learned.

                Here will be a list of all projects I've made. It's empty now as
                this is all currently a work in progress. The projects will be split
                into two main groups, "Personal" and "Academic". Personal being
                projects I've worked on in my free time, while Academic will contain
                projects I've done for some classes that I'd like to highlight. Under
                Academic I will also be including a description of the class the
                project was made for.

                Some personal projects done in my free time. Some of which worked in collaboration
                with other people. A couple projects here were done out of interest for material
                covered in lectures, such as the SQL Desktop App

                These projects were some personal favourites that I either enjoyed working on,
                or felt that I learned a lesson that has stuck with me for my somewhat young
                programming career. Plenty of collaborated works, I was definitely taught
                important lessons on working with other people. In this tab, I'll just simply
                group projects into different classes, and give a brief description of the
                class.

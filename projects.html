            Here will be a list of all projects I've made. It's empty now as
            this is all currently a work in progress. The projects will be split
            into two main groups, "Personal" and "Academic". Personal being
            projects I've worked on in my free time, while Academic will contain
            projects I've done for some classes that I'd like to highlight. Under
            Academic I will also be including a description of the class the
            project was made for.

                Some personal projects done in my free time. Some of which worked in collaboration
                with other people. A couple projects here were done out of interest for material
                covered in lectures, such as the SQL Desktop App

                These projects were some personal favourites that I either enjoyed working on,
                or felt that I learned a lesson that has stuck with me for my somewhat young
                programming career. Plenty of collaborated works, I was definitely taught
                important lessons on working with other people. In this tab, I'll just simply
                group projects into different classes, and give a brief description of the
                class.

                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                    My first experience in assembly, and low level programming in general, CPSC 355 has
                    further intensified my desire to understand the inner workings of the things
                    around me. A class that drove me to look at code from a different perspective,
                    CPSC 355 was a challenge that I personally enjoyed. To solve problems with a
                    different set of tools that I was used to up to this point, it also gave me an
                    appreciation for the mid to high level languages that I've been using.

                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                    The next step after CPSC 355, this class was an interesting step after
                    assembly. Not just simply delving to a lower level of programming, we covered
                    other interesting topics such as concurrency at a mid level language and
                    microarchitecture. CPSC 359 wasn't focused on any specific language, but rather
                    language-agnostic concepts.

                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                    Probably the most fun I've had in a class, CPSC 441 covered plenty of
                    interesting topics. The focus of this class wasn't on programming specifically,
                    but rather the principles behind the protocol stack and important network
                    concepts. What little programming that was done, was used to demonstrate our
                    understanding of the concepts taught in lecture and reinforce our knowledge.

                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                    CPCS 449 has been one of the most interesting class I've taken so far. The
                    concepts pushed me to think of programming in a different light. Functional
                    and logical programming are not typically something many programmers will
                    encounter in their lifetime; however some concepts are indeed leaking into
                    more popular languages. Being one of the few classes that truly challenged
                    me to write code like I've never written before, CPSC 449 was definitely an
                    experience I will forget.

        Here will be a list of all projects I've made. It's empty now as
        this is all currently a work in progress. The projects will be split
        into two main groups, "Personal" and "Academic". Personal being
        projects I've worked on in my free time, while Academic will contain
        projects I've done for some classes that I'd like to highlight. Under
        Academic I will also be including a description of the class the
        project was made for.

        Most of these projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/john-abo">github</a>. There is a
        public
        repository specifically for the school projects that includes content
        for other classes that I didn't feel were worth highlighting on this
        page, but are still free for people to view.

            Some personal projects done in my free time. Some of which worked in collaboration

            <p class="subheader blockContent">Sorting Algorithm Visualization</p>
            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                This project was worked in collaboration with a friend of mine, <a
                    href="https://wmcoding-mw.github.io/">William Marks</a>.
                Completed before either of us took an algorithms class, we had to do a lot of self-teaching to
                learn how exactly each algorithm worked. Using Processing, which is a Java based programming language
                with an emphasis on visualizations, we were able to create a GUI that would allow the user to see
                the algorithm in action. The largest challenge was definitely translating the algorithm into code
                that would allow us to show how each element is compared and where the elements are being moved. Of
                course, once we were able to do so, we felt as though we have gained a deeper understanding of the
                steps each algorithm used to reach the solution.
            </p>
            <img class="blockImage" alt="A sample of the GUI with an unsorted list and buttons that select the sorting algorithm that will be used" src="images/sorting_images/GUI01.PNG">
            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                As seen in the image above, we implemented four different sorting algorithms. The user is able
                to reset the randomly generated list of numbers represented by the bars at the bottom half of
                the display.
            </p>
            <img class="blockImage" alt="A sample of the GUI with a sorted list, increasing from left to right, along with buttons that select the algorithm that was used" src="images/sorting_images/GUI02.PNG">
            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                Here, the set has been sorted. What the user would see while sorting is a red bar over
                the element being compared. You can run it yourself with the code in the public repository on
                my github, feel free to play around with the different sliders if you do!
            </p>
            <img class="blockImage" alt="Sample of the code that was used to create the program. The Processing environment is visible, as well as its similarities to Java" src="images/sorting_images/sampleCode01.PNG">
            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                As you can see from the sample code, the programming environment of Processing is unique compared
                to other text editors and IDEs. This simple design is excellent for beginner projects, which is
                why we chose this language for one of our earlier projects.

            <p class="subheader blockContent">Home Forum System</p>
            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                The home forum system uses Node and Express to create the centralized server that is the back bone
                of the system. This project came to me while I was learning how to use Node, and has been a fun 
                learning exeperience. Having not yet taken CPSC 441, computer networks, there was plenty to learn 
                about http requests and other network concepts; however this didn't dissuade me from attempting this
                project. There is currently another version of this project that is currently in the works in a
                private repository, however I do not feel that it would is ready to be made public just yet.

            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                The page was written with no CSS, as the focus of the project was on the forum
                and not on the design of the UI; however I do intend to include some styling the
                next time I work on this project. The refresh button is required to get the
                updated messages from the server.

                Here is some of the scripting for the for the message page, mostly the refresh page
                function and parts of the post message function. This was also an interesting lesson
                on higher order functions, along with some light functional programming.

            <p class="subheader blockContent">SQL Desktop App</p>
            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                One of the smaller personal projects, the SQL desktop app's inspiration came from a desire to create 
                a database system for a family friend's contacts list. This coincided with the recent completion of
                ENSF 409, Principles of Software Development, where we were required to develop a small database
                management system.

                For privacy reasons, I won't be able to show the results of a query. The results
                would typically be shown as a list in the text box at the bottom of the GUI.
                Requests are made by filling the first 3 text boxes associated with an attributes
                of the tuple being inserted or searched. The button on the right that says "Export
                database" is a work in progress feature that would allow the user to get a copy of
                the table in the form of an excel spreadsheet (This was a part of the requirements
                from the family friend).

                Some code for the GUI, I used SWT on eclipse to aid in the creation of the GUI (
                Although the code screenshot was taken from visual studio code for convenience).

            These projects were some personal favourites that I either enjoyed working on,
            or felt that I learned a lesson that has stuck with me for my somewhat young
            programming career. Plenty of collaborated works, I was definitely taught
            important lessons on working with other people. In this tab, I'll just simply
            group projects into different classes, and give a brief description of the
            class.

            <p class="header blockContent">CPSC 331: Data Structures, Algorithms, and Their Analysis</p>
            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                Definitely one of the most important classes I've taken, the content of CPSC 331
                will show up in almost every computer science class I'll take from now one. Data
                structures and algorithms are essential for any computer science and software
                engineer. CPSC 331 in comparison to the other data structures and algorithms class
                had a greater emphasis on analysis, as seen in the name of the class. The
                mathematical approach to analysis has played a big role in how I approach problem
                solving.

            <p class="subheader blockContent">Assignments</p>
            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                Although a majority of the assignments were focused on proofs and design, there is
                usually a portion that was committed to implementing an algorithm or data structure
                that was related to the content of the assignment. The pseudo-code or a similar
                algorithm is covered in class, so there was little challenge besides some mapping of
                pseudo-code to Java and the occasional minor mistake in the code.
            </p>
            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                The first assignment was primarily an introduction to proofs of correctness for
                iterative and recursive algorithms, with a minor

            <p class="header blockContent">CPSC 355: Computing Machinery I</p>
            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                My first experience in assembly, and low level programming in general, CPSC 355 has
                further intensified my desire to understand the inner workings of the things
                around me. A class that drove me to look at code from a different perspective,
                CPSC 355 was a challenge that I personally enjoyed. To solve problems with a
                different set of tools that I was used to up to this point, it also gave me an
                appreciation for the mid to high level languages that I've been using.

            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                The next step after CPSC 355, this class was an interesting step after
                assembly. Not just simply delving to a lower level of programming, we covered
                other interesting topics such as concurrency at a mid level language and
                microarchitecture. CPSC 359 wasn't focused on any specific language, but rather
                language-agnostic concepts.

            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                Probably the most fun I've had in a class, CPSC 441 covered plenty of
                interesting topics. The focus of this class wasn't on programming specifically,
                but rather the principles behind the protocol stack and important network
                concepts. What little programming that was done, was used to demonstrate our
                understanding of the concepts taught in lecture and reinforce our knowledge.

                CPCS 449 has been one of the most interesting class I've taken so far. The
                concepts pushed me to think of programming in a different light. Functional
                and logical programming are not typically something many programmers will
                encounter in their lifetime; however some concepts are indeed leaking into
                more popular languages. Being one of the few classes that truly challenged
                me to write code like I've never written before, CPSC 449 was definitely an
                experience I will forget.

        Here will be a list of all projects I've made. It's empty now as
        this is all currently a work in progress. The projects will be split
        into two main groups, "Personal" and "Academic". Personal being
        projects I've worked on in my free time, while Academic will contain
        projects I've done for some classes that I'd like to highlight. Under
        Academic I will also be including a description of the class the
        project was made for.
    </p>

    <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Most of these projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/john-abo">github</a>. There is a
        public
        repository specifically for the school projects that includes content
        for other classes that I didn't feel were worth highlighting on this
        page, but are still free for people to view.

            Some personal projects done in my free time. Some of which worked in collaboration
            with other people. A couple projects here were done out of interest for material
            covered in lectures, such as the SQL Desktop App

            <p class="subheader blockContent">Sorting Algorithm Visualization</p>
            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                This project was worked in collaboration with a friend of mine, <a
                    href="https://wmcoding-mw.github.io/">William Marks</a>.
                Completed before either of us took an algorithms class, we had to do a lot of self-teaching to
                learn how exactly each algorithm worked. Using Processing, which is a Java based programming language
                with an emphasis on visualizations, we were able to create a GUI that would allow the user to see
                the algorithm in action. The largest challenge was definitely translating the algorithm into code
                that would allow us to show how each element is compared and where the elements are being moved. Of
                course, once we were able to do so, we felt as though we have gained a deeper understanding of the
                steps each algorithm used to reach the solution.

                The home forum system uses Node and Express to create the centralized server that is the back bone
                of the system. This project came to me while I was learning how to use Node, and has been a fun 
                learning exeperience. Having not yet taken CPSC 441, computer networks, there was plenty to learn 
                about http requests and other network concept; however this didn't dissuade me from attempting this
                project. There is currently another version of this project that is currently in the works in a
                private repository, however I do not feel that it would is ready to be made public just yet.

            <p class="blockContent" style="text-indent: 25px;">
                One of the smaller personal projects, the SQL desktop app's inspiration came from a desire to create 
                a database system for a family friend's contacts list. This coincided with the recent completion of
                ENSF 409, Principles of Software Development, where we were required to develop a small database
                management system.

            These projects were some personal favourites that I either enjoyed working on,
            or felt that I learned a lesson that has stuck with me for my somewhat young
            programming career. Plenty of collaborated works, I was definitely taught
            important lessons on working with other people. In this tab, I'll just simply
            group projects into different classes, and give a brief description of the
            class.
        </p><br>
        <div>
            <p class="subheader">CPSC 331: Data Structures, Algorithms, and Their Analysis</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                Definitely one of the most important classes I've taken, the content of CPSC 331
                will show up in almost every computer science class I'll take from now one. Data
                structures and algorithms are essential for any computer science and software
                engineer. CPSC 331 in comparison to the other data structures and algorithms class
                had a greater emphasis on analysis, as seen in the name of the class. The
                mathematical approach to analysis has played a big role in how I approach problem
                solving.

        <div>
            <p class="subheader">CPSC 355: Computing Machinery I</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                My first experience in assembly, and low level programming in general, CPSC 355 has
                further intensified my desire to understand the inner workings of the things
                around me. A class that drove me to look at code from a different perspective,
                CPSC 355 was a challenge that I personally enjoyed. To solve problems with a
                different set of tools that I was used to up to this point, it also gave me an
                appreciation for the mid to high level languages that I've been using.
            </p>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <p class="subheader">CPSC 359: Computing Machinery II</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                The next step after CPSC 355, this class was an interesting step after
                assembly. Not just simply delving to a lower level of programming, we covered
                other interesting topics such as concurrency at a mid level language and
                microarchitecture. CPSC 359 wasn't focused on any specific language, but rather
                language-agnostic concepts.

        <div>
            <p class="subheader">CPSC 441: Computer Networks</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                Probably the most fun I've had in a class, CPSC 441 covered plenty of
                interesting topics. The focus of this class wasn't on programming specifically,
                but rather the principles behind the protocol stack and important network
                concepts. What little programming that was done, was used to demonstrate our
                understanding of the concepts taught in lecture and reinforce our knowledge.
            </p>
        </div><br>
        <div>
            <p class="subheader">CPSC 449: Programming Paradigms</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                CPCS 449 has been one of the most interesting class I've taken so far. The
                concepts pushed me to think of programming in a different light. Functional
                and logical programming are not typically something many programmers will
                encounter in their lifetime; however some concepts are indeed leaking into
                more popular languages. Being one of the few classes that truly challenged
                me to write code like I've never written before, CPSC 449 was definitely an
                experience I will forget.
